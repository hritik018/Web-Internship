                Plagiarism & Copyright Infringement
            </h2>
            <p class="indent">
                There are similarities and difference between plagiarism and copyright infringement, a construct of the
                law and ethics. Copyright infringement is a construct of the law and which means plagiarism is the
                construct of ethics. These two things are bad and has a greater cost than any legal judgement, they can
                both play out in the court of public opinion. Taking credit for something that you didn't create can
                bring you to these extremes.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Plagiarism is not the construct of law but it is the construct of ethics. In the article, The Difference
                Between Copyright Infringement and Plagiarism, it states that “plagiarism is defined as the taking the
                original work or works of another and presenting it as your own.” So it’s not the fact that you stole it
                but the fact you present it as your own when it’s not. You’re not giving the original creator credit for
                what they’ve done. You’re pretty much stealing somebody else’s work and lying about it saying it’s yours
                when it’s not like that. Though ideas can be plagiarized but for it not to count as plagiarism you would
                have to use quotes, re-wording still counts as plagiarism because you’re still using the same structure
                of the sentence. Now to begin on trying to avoid plagiarism instead of copying things or re-wording you
                can summarize things in your own words; Put things in your point of view or in other words giving your
                perspective.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Copyright infringement is only when whatever you use are copyright, if its not copyright it doesn’t
                count as an infringement. If you have something, for example an article you write online or create a
                website that is copyright and you see that someone else has copied it, or has been taken without
                permission, you can then sue them since you have exclusive rights over this. Copyright does not have an
                expiration date it stays the same so when someone tries to take something that is not theirs and it
                belongs to an important person the right to sue could be pursued but the thing is if they could talk to
                the person who owns the page or site and they allow them to use what has been said or written then it
                wouldn't be copyright. Now being able to say that the right to copy something that doesn't belong is not
                right then again it’s considered a copyright infringement.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Some differences between plagiarism and copyright infringement are that for copyright infringement you
                can actually sue someone but not for plagiarism. Trying to consist on something that is considered
                against the law to important people But plagiarism isn’t violating the laws it's making a change in
                something that is different from it actually is. Though if you actually think about it what does it do
                to your life when you plagiarize; It practically changes the way people look at you when you give
                something to them or try to explain something because then that's where trust comes in because they
                trusted that you would do the work on your own and not try to take something that is not your and then
                you take something that isn't your and use it for yourself then you lose all trust to the one who
                trusted that you would do it on your own.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                In conclusion similarities and difference between plagiarism and copyright infringement; Are actually
                way restricted then we actually think but the thing is doing what most kids do in teenage *and some
                college students?* Everything is considered to be a easier way out of things but the thing is what is
                the point of doing it if all it does is cause trouble and disagreement. Difference between the two
                “plagiarism and copyright infringement” are something we ourself can't change and now that many people
                do that and do not give credit to the actual writer is wrong in all behalfs now doing so there is a
                constricted area between the both one you can sue and your life could be over people could go to jail
                for plagiarism then again they could be let go if they say the right things in court and say they will
                give credit to the actual write or performer that has a written text now if you actually think about it
                how many people do you think actually get away with this ? Following with this article that stated “59%
                of high school students admitted cheating on a test during the last year. 34% self-reported doing it
                more than two times.” mostly teens and college kids do this it states that “36% of undergraduates admit
                to “paraphrasing/copying few sentences from Internet source without footnoting it.” and that is because
                it is collage children; Then again nobody's perfect but they should consider thinking about what they do
                and what it could do to their lives.
